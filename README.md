Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing a dataset of security incidents to build a predictive model. The notebook includes detailed steps to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data, followed by the development of a machine learning model using TensorFlow.

Dataset Description

The dataset used in this notebook is related to security incidents and includes various features such as:

	•	Id, OrgId, IncidentId, AlertId, DetectorId, DeviceId: Identifiers for different entities.
	•	Feature1, Feature2, … FeatureN: Various features representing incident characteristics.
	•	The target variable is likely related to the severity or type of incident.

The dataset is split into two parts:

	•	Raw data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Microsoft/microsoft-security-incident-prediction/data
        •	GUIDE_Train.csv: Used for training the model.
        •	GUIDE_Test.csv: Used for evaluating the model’s performance.



Repository Structure

Environment Setup

	•	Libraries Imported:
	•	pandas, numpy, matplotlib: For data manipulation and visualization.
	•	tensorflow: For building the machine learning model.
	•	scipy, sklearn: For additional statistical analysis and machine learning utilities.
	•	Version Check:
	•	The Python environment version is printed to ensure compatibility.

Data Loading and Exploration

	•	Data Loading:
	•	The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv, with a subset of rows (nrows=10000) used for initial exploration.
	•	Initial Exploration:
	•	The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using df_train.head().
	•	Data types and basic statistics are checked using df_train.info().

Data Preprocessing

	•	Dropping Unnecessary Columns:
	•	Columns such as Id, OrgId, IncidentId, AlertId, DetectorId, DeviceId are dropped as they do not contribute to the predictive model.
	•	Handling Missing Data:
	•	A custom function drop_column_with_over_50_percent_missing(df) is defined to remove columns with more than 50% missing values.
	•	Further Cleaning:
	•	Other preprocessing steps might include filling missing values, normalization, and standardization (though these are inferred from the initial steps and would be detailed in subsequent cells).

Feature Engineering

	•	Feature Selection:
	•	Specific features that contribute to the prediction of the target variable are selected based on exploratory analysis.
	•	Transformation:
	•	Features are transformed as necessary, possibly including encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, etc.

Model Building

	•	Model Architecture:
	•	A neural network model is built using TensorFlow’s Sequential API.
	•	The model likely includes multiple layers (Dense layers) to capture the complex relationships in the data.
	•	Compilation:
	•	The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics.
	•	Training:
	•	The model is trained on the training dataset, with the process including tracking of loss and accuracy over epochs.

Model Evaluation

	•	Performance Metrics:
	•	The model’s performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (these would be included based on the specific code cells dedicated to evaluation).
	•	Visualization:
	•	Training and validation loss/accuracy are plotted to assess the model’s learning behavior.
	•	Confusion matrix, ROC curves, or other diagnostic plots might be used to evaluate model performance on the test dataset.

Results

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of the data and the resulting predictive model. The key results include:

	•	A trained TensorFlow model capable of predicting security incidents.
	•	Insights into the most significant features contributing to predictions.
	•	Evaluation metrics that help understand the model’s strengths and areas for improvement.
